Spring Petclinic 
PetClinic demonstrates the use of a Spring Boot with Spring MVC and Spring Data. 
The PetClinic has an old and varied history dating right back to the beginning of the Spring Framework. 
It started life as a demonstration of nearly all the common things that you could do with Spring, 
back when it was possible to conceive of such a demonstration. These days it is a very small slice 
of what you could achieve, but the community has a soft spot for it, so it's nice to see it still 
going after all this time, so we hope you enjoy it too.
